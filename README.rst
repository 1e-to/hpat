A compiler-based framework for big data in Python
#################################################

High Performance Analytics Toolkit (HPAT) is a compiler-based framework for big
data analytics and machine learning on cluster/cloud environments that
is both easy to use and extremely fast; it is orders of magnitude faster than
alternatives like `Apache Spark <http://spark.apache.org/>`_.

HPAT automatically or semi-automatically parallelizes analytics tasks written in
Numpy and pandas and generates efficient MPI code using Numba and LLVM.
These academic papers describe the underlying methods in HPAT:

- `HPAT at HotOS'17 <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3103004>`_
- `HiFrames on arxiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02341>`_
